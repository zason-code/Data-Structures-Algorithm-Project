 * The interface to implement for the 2020 CITS2200 Data Structures and Algorithms Project.
 * Your implementation MUST provide a zero-argument constructor, which will be the only one used when assessing your submission.
 * 
 * All questions work with a greyscale image specified as a 2D int array.
 * The array is indexed first by row, then by column.
 * Every row in the array will be the same length.
 * Every element in the array will be non-negative and no greater than 255.
 * A value of 0 represents a black pixel, and a value of 255 represents white, with shades of grey in between.
 * 
 * Time complexity specifications use R for number of rows, C for number of columns, and P = R*C for number of pixels.
